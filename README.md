Made a project in django framework that uses youtube data api to fetch videos in reverse chronological order on the topic entered in the search bar and returns nine top videos in the form of a dashboard. 
Each of the nine card in the dashboard contains the thumbnail,title and a view button whuch redirects the user to the actual youtube video.
The api calls itself again in 10 minutes to fetch the latest videos by using the python libraries of schedule and time.
